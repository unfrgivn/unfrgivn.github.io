### Problem
As privacy and consumer protection laws changed and browser functionality evolved, it became increasingly difficult to manage user sessions to fulfill products. It was also challenging to carry sessions across multiple web applications running on different tech stacks.

### Goal
Maintain the complex web of analytics and transactional data required to carry out order flows, provide SSO access to products, and allow for custom user experiences without relying on cookies or client-side storage.

### Criteria
- Create a seamless UX while managing state in a decoupled backend.
- Automatically stitch together the session across multiple web apps and devices.
- Work with any programming and storage stack.
- Respect user privacy settings and redact data where necessary.

### Outcome
- **Multi-language Support**: Libraries built for use with PHP, Python, Node.js, and Ruby.
- **Flexibility**: Configurable with anonymous or known customer IDs and flexible storage options (local files, RDBMS, NoSQL, Redis).
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with analytics suites like Google Analytics and Snowplow.
- **Open Source**: Built as OSS and fully extensible.

### Tech Stack
- JavaScript
- Redis / MongoDB / SQL
- PHP / Python / Ruby
