### Problem
When using the OSS version of ksqlDB, all work is done via the CLI; there is no management interface, error handling, or versioning. This made it challenging to test, onboard new pipelines, and pair-program with other engineers.

### Goal
Create deployable data models that could go from source topics through infinite stream/table transformations and produce enriched stream, tables, or topics.

### Criteria
- Models fully managed as KSQL files inside a repository using our common development tools for code quality, testing, and CI/CD.
- Easy to spin up and tear down for feature branches with ability to siphon off limited data sets from source topics for testing.
- Models are ephemeral and can always be destroyed and recreated assuming the source data persists.

### Outcome
- Leveraged in-house MetamorphosisJS framework to deploy application with simple configuration for environment and model. This allowed for executing ksqlDB commands in the proper order and with detailed error handling.
- Rudimentary ERD visualization of ksqlDB components along with change logs helped quickly diagnose issues and understand changes in data behavior.
- Configurable materialization of tables and stream sink to RDBMS or data lake/warehouse storage.
