summary: Unified set of development tools, plugins, libraries, and CI/CD pipelines used across all applications.
highlights:
  - Centralized development tools and CI/CD pipelines in a monorepo.
  - Standardized code quality, testing, and deployment processes across teams.
  - Automated dependency management and versioning with semantic release.

### Problem
- Lack of process around tool selection lead to multiple packages for code quality, testing, and functionality.
- Repeated use of contributed packages lead to scattered and inconsistent versions and configuration.

### Goals
Drive all packages and shared development tools from a central repository that could be updated, documented, and governed by DevSecOps.

### Criteria
- Singular instruction set for configuration and definition of contributed packages
- Deploys artifacts that are compatible out-of-the-box with common package managers
- The repository itself is managed using the development tools it hosts

### Outcome
- **Monorepo**: Created with self-referencing configuration for code quality and transposition.
- **Componentization**: Individual components for linting, compiling, testing, common libraries, conventional commits, and more all built, tested, and deployed to read-only mirrors and package indecies.
- **Automation**: Smart-detection of changes with dependency chaining used to ensure that only necessary packages were rebuilt and properly versioned based on conventional commits.

### Scope
- **CI/CD**: Build images, Deploy images, Deploy app to GKE, Push build to mirrors
- **PHP**: Coding standards, Composer plugin template, Helper library, Wordpress Plugins
- **Python**: Helper library, Pylint, unittest config
- **JS**: Babel, browserslist, eslint, prettier, stylelint, utils, webpack

### Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python, PHP, JavaScript
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions
