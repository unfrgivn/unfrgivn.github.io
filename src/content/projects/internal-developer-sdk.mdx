### Problem
Developers were spending too much time learning environment and DevOps skills and the time to bring in junior engineers and have them coding was unacceptable. Lack of standards also lead to technology fragmentation as well as multiple solutions for the same problems within our DevOps pipelines depending on the team.

### Goals
Build a central repository of runbooks and automations for common development tasks.

### Criteria
- Automate the setup of a new developer computer through scripted playbooks.
- Provide guardrails to enforce our coding standards and Git branching strategy.
- Easily extensible to add new features in an Agile fashion.

### Outcome
- Forked a tool built by IFTTT and augmented the functionality to meet our engineering needs on Mac and Linux systems.
- Tools for new machine setup, creating new applications, branching off new environments, code quality and standards, testing, deployments, and documentation.
- Integrations to automated actions through our GitHub and GCP accounts.
