### Problem
Needed to consolidate multiple landing page systems, email marketing templates, funnel flows, and provide end-to-end customer analytics for multi-path funnels.

### Goals
Allow marketers to rapidly deploy complex funnels and manage their campaigns without intervention from tech. Avoid manual hacks like pasting embed codes and tracking scripts onto individual landing pages which is unsustainable to manage change at our volume.

### Criteria
- Easy for non-technical folk to onboard and manage.
- Create or buy a system which leverages as much contributed code or SaaS as possible.
- Extensible to our unique business needs. Most platforms are sold for e-commerce or a funnel with a cohesive line of products, whereas direct response marketing is more tailored to the user + campaign with varying cross/upsells.
- Compatible with our current SaaS vendors for email marketing, campaign management and customer engagement.

### Outcome
- **Modernization**: Built on top of Wordpress, leveraging vendor tools for landing page management that could be extended with custom modules for order forms and other CTAs.
- **Integration**: All of our SaaS vendors has existing integrations or we could extend the theme to incorporate various tracking scripts and customer data.
- **Tracking**: Able to plug our cross-application session tracking in with ease.

### Tech Stack
- **Languages**: PHP, JavaScript
- **Frameworks**: React
- **Database**: MySQL
