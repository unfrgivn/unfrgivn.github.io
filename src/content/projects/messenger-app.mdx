### Problem
Customers are messaging each other using email and SMS which does not allow for us to handle non-responsive matches or filter out violations to our terms of service.

### Goals
Provide a native messaging app that looks and feels on par with the other major service our demographic uses daily: Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, etc…

### Criteria
- Available for both iOS and Android
- Secure platform that allows messages to be checked for violations without providing access to the message content to any database users.
- Message frequency and patterns are analyzed to foster communication and ensure that mentors are holding up their commitments.
- Expected feature set should mirror iChat: messaging, read notices, gifs, pictures, and video.
- Push notification with preferences to manage conversation alerts.

### Outcome
- **Native Experience**: App built with React Native + Typescript with some native module customization done in Swift/Kotlin.
- **Event-Driven**: Kafka used to build event-driven API for push notifications.
- **Real-Time**: Feathers.js used to broadcast state changes to all app users via websockets.

### Tech Stack
- **Mobile**: React Native, Swift, Kotlin
- **Backend**: NodeJS, Feathers.js
- **Infrastructure**: Kafka
