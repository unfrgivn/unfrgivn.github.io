### Problem
A black-box fulfillment system consisting of legacy customer-service and marketing operations desktop applications was no longer supported by the vendor. The aging app had long onboarding times, zero resiliency, locked functionality, vague error handling, security blindspots, and lacked modern OS support.

### Goal
Systematically replace this aging monolith with a modular and modern system that could handle business needs today and moving forward.

### Outcome
- **Modernization**: Deprecated both windows desktop apps over the course of two years in a phased approach.
- **Remote Access**: Expanded the ability of employees to work in the system remotely and securely.
- **Efficiency**: Accelerated business team outcomes by providing a feature pipeline with accurate forecasts for labor and management.

### Tech Stack
- **Front-end**: React.js, TypeScript, Sass / CSS
- **Back-end**: Microservice APIs (Node.js + Express, Python, PHP), FeatherJS socket API middleware, WordPress
- **Database**: MySQL, Oracle
