### Problem
Dozens of independent websites running a variety of OSS and custom CMS platforms with no consistency or integration, despite serving many of the same customers.

### Goals
Create a consistent and integrated platform that benefited the customer experience and simplified the training and management for product teams.

### Criteria
- Use a single CMS platform that is easily extensible and has a large developer market for in-house and contract work.
- If OSS, platform must have a good track record for vulnerability management and provide timely patches.
- Baseline feature parity across all products, but allow for extending functionality on top.
- Seamless customer experience by leveraging single sign-on and central account management portal.

### Outcome
- **Unified Platform**: Custom Wordpress framework build that incorporated our engineering best practices, subscription and CRM systems.
- **Flexibility**: Content can be managed centrally and sync out to the spokes, or managed natively on each application and sync back to the hub.
- **Security**: Least-privilege RBAC to allow access to a range of internal and external contributors.

### Tech Stack
- **CMS**: Wordpress
- **Languages**: PHP, JavaScript
- **Frameworks**: React
- **Data**: MySQL, Redis
