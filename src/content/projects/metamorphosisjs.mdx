summary: NodeJS framework for building powerful, event-driven streams.
highlights:
  - Created a developer-friendly framework for Kafka integration in Node.js.
  - Reduced complexity for junior developers to build event-driven applications.
  - Included built-in support for Schema Registry, Avro, and database adapters.

### Problem
We desired to expand use of Kafka, but setting up consumers and producers was cumbersome and leaned heavily on senior engineers with Java experience.

### Goal
Create a NodeJS framework that a junior developer, who primarily works in backend Javascript, could integrate Kafka workflows into their applications.

### Criteria
- Allow consuming/producing from/to multiple topics with a simple config abstraction and common NodeJS skills. All available kafkajs options for performance and concurrency should be available.
- At-least-once guarantee operations for consumers.
- Clear debug logging to help novice Kafka users understand breakdowns in their consumers and producers.
- Pluggable to allow for reusable consumer and producers for common tasks as well as different data adapters used in source/sink workloads.
- It should be easy to maintain and update similar to any OSS framework and maintain backwards compatibility with all minor version updates.

### Outcome
- **Efficiency**: Express-like framework that allowed for building a full-featured NodeJS app to integrate with Kafka in just a few lines of code.
- **Integration**: Database adapter allows easy read/write from DB provider modules. First use-case was to replace Kafka Connect and overcome slow performance and feature limitations of existing JDBC sink connector.
- **Data Integrity**: Schema registry added for leveraging Avro messages.
- **Versatility**: Integrated webserver for creating producer endpoints; primarily used for capturing webhooks.
- **Open Source**: Built as OSS and fully extensible.

### Tech Stack
- **Language**: JavaScript (TypeScript)
- **Infrastructure**: Kafka, ksqlDB
