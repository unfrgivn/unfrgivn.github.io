### Problem
Developers were managing long-lived AWS/Azure access keys locally, leading to security risks, potential leakage, and difficulty in rotating credentials during incidents.

### Goal
Fully govern access keys by generating all access keys through a secure vending machine product and managing them in our enterprise secrets manager.

### Outcome
- Built a secure "vending machine" API that generates short-lived credentials.
- Integrated with HashiCorp Vault for secure storage and retrieval.
- Enforced MFA for all credential generation.
- Drastically reduced the attack surface by eliminating permanent static credentials on developer workstations.
